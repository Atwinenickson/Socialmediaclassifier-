"HELP!!! My husband and I ??contributed money???? to buy a 'first-class second-hand' car ?? as he calls it. I contributed 70% and he contributed 30%. However he registered the car in his name. The log book shows he is the sole owner of the car. When I questioned why he didn’t include my name on the log book he got very angry at me. He doesn’t allow me to drive OUR car. He now tells me to buy myself a third-hand or old car ?? to drive around and perfect my driving skills so that when I drive the 'first-class second-hand' car we bought together I do not scratch it or knock when driving.  I feel robbed i feel broken ???? What should I do?  Hurting Wife. Kindly advise a hurting wife??. 	", The guy is right! Do u know that he has 100%of your goodies and leaves u move with it to places he doesn't know and rarely complain.... so what makes 70% you have contributed on a DMC that rusts bothers you so much? Ok advice, neutral 
my husband has a car, LetÂ’s be clear on this by the time they bought the car am sure they both agreed to have the car log book in his ( manÂ’s) name she sounds clear that they both agreed to contribute meaning she strongly accepted knowing the guy had less to contribute and they went ahead to purchase the car with out any complaint and no issues came up when the car was being bought meaning everything was okay with her by then when the lady was deep in love not to read between two lines. This woman should be clear and tell us that she conflicted with the man over other issues now she feels cheated then the car log book should be in her names. I advise her to chose between the car and the relationship. I wish she consulted us before this turned out to be an issue.,neutral
driving second hand cars is being cheap, My dear your story same as mine. Mine was actually 90% buying including those URA taxes. First he was mbu i cant drive well so what i did was go to my best friend who helped me perfect my driving skills. Second it was always about who steps in the car first in the morning. I made sure i was ready very early gave him a few minutes and then drove off. When it would break down he would then use the opportunity mbu anti gwe driver bring money we work on the car. Sometimes i would swallow and work on it it went on like that until it broke the engine. At that point i had collected my other little monies i added a small loan and bought my own car. I told him to work on the other old one and use since its in his names. He could not afford as the engine was damaged too much he needed over 40M. The guy came down he behaved that he now would ask me for mine whenever he needed to use it. I had a right to say yes or no. It takes courage and determination but yes you can do it. We have been there girl you have a right to enjoy your 70% just fight harder. Dont give up, positive
i wont marry soon, Ladies buy your own cars. These men now days like free things from women. I love seing a lady driving her spacio that she bought using her own money.,postive
