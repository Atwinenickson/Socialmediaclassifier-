It's a godsend chance for the will-be-released inmates to fit well in society  gaining acceptance within their native communities. The population has to forgive them for offences of the past (for which they've already served sentences) & give them new leases of life. References to the gravity of offences committed  as the case was with Kooky  would be injurious to the wellbeing of these returnees to 'normal life'. Let's forgive their past. Who doesn't err at one point or another? We're treading along a new path  shaping a new Uganda for the better.....let's welcome them with brotherly love. There's no room for reprisals. A good 'mark' of statesmanship.,positive

Uganda among top US aid recipients,Shame on us. That represents alot of dependence for a 50 + year old independent country as we call ourselves.
