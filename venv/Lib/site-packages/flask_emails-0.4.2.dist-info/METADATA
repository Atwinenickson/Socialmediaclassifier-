      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each

      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor

      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

Description: flask-emails
        ============
        
        The **flask-emails** extension is a simple way to send email messages from Flask application.
        It is a wrapper for `python-emails <http://github.com/lavr/python-emails>`_.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Email message abstraction with html and text part, with inline attachments, etc.
        - Email body template rendering
        - Email HTML body transform methods: css inlining, image inlining, etc.
        - SMTP backends
        - DKIM signature
        - Configured via Flask application config
        
        .. note::
        
                There are another flask extension `Flask-Mail <http://packages.python.org/Flask-Mail/>`_
                which solves almost same problems. I guess **flask-emails** solves little more problems.
        
        Quickstart
        ----------
        
        Add email-specific options to your flask application, for example:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
                from flask import Flask
                app = Flask(__name__)
                app.config = {'EMAIL_HOST': 'localhost', 'EMAIL_PORT': 25, 'EMAIL_TIMEOUT': 10}
        
        Create and send email:
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
                from flask_emails import Message
        
                message = Message(html='<html><p>Hi! ...',
                                  subject="Party today",
                                  mail_from=("John Brown", "john@gmail.com"))
                message.attach(data=open('Event.ics', 'rb'), filename='Event.ics')
        
                r = message.send(to=("Nick Jackson", "nick@gmail.com"))
        
                if r.status_code not in [250, ]:
                    # message is not sent, deal with this
                    ...
        
        See more examples on `python-emails docs <https://github.com/lavr/python-emails/blob/master/README.rst#examples>`_
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        By default **flask-emails** reads configuration from current Flask application config
        when you first time create :meth:`~Message` object.
        
        It reads the following variables:
        
        .. tabularcolumns:: |p{6.5cm}|p{8.5cm}|
        
        =============================== ==================================================================
        ``EMAIL_HOST``                  The host to use for sending email.
        
                                        Default: ``'localhost'``
        
        ``EMAIL_PORT``                  Port to use for the SMTP server defined in ``EMAIL_HOST``.
        
                                        Default: ``25``
        
        ``EMAIL_HOST_USER``             Username to use for the SMTP server defined in ``EMAIL_HOST``.
                                        If empty, emails won’t attempt authentication.
        
                                        Default: empty
        
        ``EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD``         Password to use for the SMTP server defined in ``EMAIL_HOST``.
                                        This setting is used in conjunction with ``EMAIL_HOST_USER`` when authenticating to the SMTP server.
        
                                        Default: empty
        
        ``EMAIL_USE_TLS``               Whether to use a TLS (secure) connection when talking to the SMTP server.
                                        This is used for explicit TLS connections, generally on port 587.
                                        If you are experiencing hanging connections, see the implicit TLS setting ``EMAIL_USE_SSL``.
        
                                        Default: ``False``
        
        ``EMAIL_USE_SSL``               Whether to use an implicit TLS (secure) connection when talking to the SMTP server.
                                        In most email documentation this type of TLS connection is referred to as SSL.
                                        It is generally used on port 465.
                                        If you are experiencing problems, see the explicit TLS setting ``EMAIL_USE_TLS``.
        
                                        Note that ``EMAIL_USE_TLS``/``EMAIL_USE_SSL`` are mutually exclusive, so only set one
                                        of those settings to ``True``.
        
                                        Default: ``False``
        
        ``EMAIL_SSL_CERTFILE``          If ``EMAIL_USE_SSL`` is True, you can optionally specify the path
                                        to a PEM-formatted certificate chain file to use for the SSL connection.
        
                                        Default: ``None``
        
        ``EMAIL_SSL_KEYFILE``           If ``EMAIL_USE_SSL`` is ``True``, you can optionally specify the path
                                        to a PEM-formatted private key file to use for the SSL connection.
        
                                        Note that setting ``EMAIL_SSL_CERTFILE`` and ``EMAIL_SSL_KEYFILE`` doesn’t result
                                        in any certificate checking. They’re passed to the underlying SSL connection.
        
                                        Please refer to the documentation of Python’s ``ssl.wrap_socket()`` function
                                        for details on how the certificate chain file and private key file are handled.
        
                                        Default: ``None``
        
        ``EMAIL_TIMEOUT``               Specifies a timeout in seconds for blocking operations like the connection attempt.
        
                                        Default: ``30``
        
        ``EMAIL_SMTP_DEBUG``            Be verbose on smtp commands. The same as ``debug`` parameter in ``smtplib.SMTP``
        
                                        Default: ``0``
        
        ``EMAIL_BACKEND``               The backend class to use for sending emails.
                                        Available backends are default ``emails.backend.stmp.SMTPBackend`` and ``flask_emails.backend.DummyBackend`` (which do not send anything, useful for testing environments).
        
                                        Default: ``emails.backend.SMTPBackend``
